Cheating in The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ can be done in different ways, depending on the platform and the desired effect. Here are some of the most common methods:
 
- **Using seeds:** Seeds are codes that can be entered at the start of a run to generate a specific layout of floors, items, and enemies. Some seeds have special effects that alter the gameplay, such as making all enemies friendly, reversing the controls, or applying a filter to the graphics. These seeds can be found online or discovered by experimenting. However, using seeds will disable achievements and unlocks for that run.
- **Using mods:** Mods are modifications that can be downloaded and installed to change various aspects of the game, such as adding new items, characters, enemies, or graphics. Mods can be found on websites like Steam Workshop or Nexus Mods. Some mods may require additional software or steps to work properly. Using mods will also disable achievements and unlocks for that run.
- **Using cheat engine:** Cheat engine is a program that can be used to manipulate the memory of a game and alter its values, such as health, coins, keys, bombs, or items. Cheat engine can be downloaded from its official website and used with The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ by following some tutorials or guides online. Using cheat engine will not disable achievements and unlocks for that run, but it may cause glitches or crashes.

Cheating in The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ can be fun and rewarding for some players, but it may also ruin the challenge and enjoyment of the game for others. It is up to each player to decide how they want to play the game and what consequences they are willing to accept.
  
Secrets and Easter Eggs
 
Afterbirth+ has countless secrets and easter eggs that can provide players with helpful benefits or just some fun surprises. The most obvious are the game's secret rooms and super secret rooms. Secret rooms will always be bordered by at least three other rooms, but will never border the boss room or the treasure room. Super secret rooms will only be bordered by one room, usually the last one before the boss room. Both types of rooms can be accessed by bombing the walls that hide them, and they can contain various items, consumables, or special events. Players should look for cracks or gaps in the walls to find them.
 
Another type of secret is the transformation. Transformations occur when the player collects three or more items from a certain set, such as Guppy items, Mushroom items, or Mom items. Transformations grant the player a cosmetic change and a bonus effect, such as flight, extra damage, or poison tears. Some transformations are more common and useful than others, but they can all add some spice to a run.
 
Easter eggs are hidden references or jokes that can be found in various places in the game. Some examples are the arcade machines that can play mini-games based on other indie titles, the posters and graffiti that reference pop culture or memes, or the special seeds that change the game in weird ways. Easter eggs are mostly for fun and do not affect the gameplay much, but they can add some flavor and humor to the game.
